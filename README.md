Be restul my friend (Golang)
============================

The idea is to create a dummy project about a Restful API in Golang to get some experience in this language and try other flavors on programming languages.

# Docker in place

I like to dockerize any webservice so I'll try to do the same with this project:

```
# Build command:
# docker build -t moriorgames/go-api .
# Run command:
# docker run -td --name go_api -p 8080:8080 moriorgames/go-api
```

# Fire a build in travisCi :)
